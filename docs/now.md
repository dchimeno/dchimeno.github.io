# Now

This is my now page â€”a public snapshot of my current top priorities, inspired by the [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com) initiative.

- Advocating for the benefits of post-aggregation, particularly with ClickHouse.  
- Transitioning projects from pre-aggregation to post-aggregation.  
- Expanding my knowledge of ClickHouse, data formats, and data ordering.
- Devoting time to my family.
- Improving this blog, sharing content and stepping into IndieWeb.
