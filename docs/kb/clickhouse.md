    sum(rows),
    formatReadableSize(sum(data_compressed_bytes) AS comp_bytes) AS comp,
    formatReadableSize(sum(data_uncompressed_bytes) AS uncomp_bytes) AS uncomp,
    uncomp_bytes / comp_bytes AS ratio
FROM system.parts
WHERE active AND table like '%name%'
GROUP BY

ORDER BY comp_bytes DESC
```


##Â Show table definitions

FROM system.columns
WHERE table LIKE '%raw%'
ORDER BY table ASC, data_compressed_bytes desc
```

## view data distribution
